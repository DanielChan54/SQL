#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--Q1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND
orderID <> 'Order ID';


--Q2. How many of the January orders were iPhones?
    
    SELECT COUNT(orderID)
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
    AND Product = 'iPhone';
    
    
-- Q3. Select the customer accounts for all the orders placed in February
    
    SELECT acctnum
    FROM BIT_DB.customers
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
    ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

--Q4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January? What was the price?

SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;


--Q5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT product
,SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'
GROUP BY product;

--Q6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101? 
How many of each were sold? (Quantity)
What was the total revenue? (SUM(quantity)*price)

SELECT 
SUM(quantity)
,product
,SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


--Q7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February? What was the average amount spent for those customers? (acctnum from BIT_DB.customers)
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum)
,avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

--Q8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February. Include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product
